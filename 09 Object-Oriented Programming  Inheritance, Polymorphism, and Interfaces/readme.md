# Inheritance
## Introduction to Inheritance Concepts

- **Definition:**
  - **Inheritance** is a fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept.
  - It allows a class to acquire properties and behaviors from another class.

- **Purpose:**
  - **Code Reusability:** Inheritance promotes reuse of code, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
  - **Hierarchy:** Classes can be organized in a hierarchy, making it easier to manage and extend the system.

- **Key Terms:**
  - **Superclass:** The class being inherited from; also known as the parent class.
  - **Subclass:** The class that inherits from another class; also known as the child class.

- **Benefits:**
  - Efficient code development, as existing functionality can be leveraged.
  - Promotes a clear and organized structure for classes in a program.
